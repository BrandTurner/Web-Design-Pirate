## Motivation & Description
It is hard to look at a website and copy only a small part of it (widget/component/element). One could copy the full HTML and all CSS files and then try to filter out things we don't need, but that would take too much time...

**Web Design Pirate** is a DevTools extension that allows you to select an HTML node, and then gives you only the CSS styles that you need to render the full component. Optionally, for copying wrapper-style components it also allows you to specify the level of inner HTML content that can be thrown away (to further reduce the number of needed CSS styles).

## Examples
For instance I like Facebook's *Create a Post* widget. I select it using Chrome Developer Tools Inspector, switch to my Web Design Pirate tab, and copy the result.

## TODO
- It's painfully slow (devtools freeze) for large chunks of HTML (e.g. expedia html body) - maybe remove deep level innerHTML already in content scripts (assume interest in wrapper element)
- Add option to add CSS prefixes e.g. _abc123 in front of all to isolate component and allow complete copy paste - check how react does it; And replace relative urls in CSS
- Slider to remove inner levels of HTML - show how many CSS lines it produces + rerender result + cache uncss calls
- maybe perform repeated uncss requests with reduced css (from previous calls) and only first call with all stylesheets
